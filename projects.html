              It's built in Spark, an apache technology which has a great
              capability in managing tons of data per second. The project uses
              MongoDB as a database in which store data. It also support Hadoop
              file system, from which he can read and write files. It's based on
              Spring Boot, with a few APIs that handles all the flow, a useful
              Swagger is provided.

              >
              This project is related to a course I had to create for new
              entries in my old job. It was built to showcase the basic features
              of React and how to integrate a framework, which in this case was
              Grommet V2.0.

              <a href="https://github.com/dasher7/shelfify">Shelfify:</a> This
              project is the natural evolution of Taskify. As an organized
              person, I'd like to memo and save-to-a-safe-and-handy place things
              I've watched, read, played. It's a little and easy to use digital
              library in which you can store whatever you want. Built in React
              and Ant Design with Firebase as a service.

              >
              GraphQL, as a lover of API design, to me, was love at first sight.
              But when it comes to integrate with pure Java, it was a pain in
              the neck. That's a basic bootstrap that may come in handy, but I
              warn you: don't you dare use GraphQL with Java. Please, don't.

              >
              WebFlux was a huge surprise to me. It's finding is related to the
              realtime engine I was building. I had to show in realtime what was
              going on into the database. A file got saved? A file must be shown
              to the user. And there is WebFlux. A huge thanks to Spring Boot to
              always simplify my life.
