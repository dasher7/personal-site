          Hello, World! I am Andrea.
          <br />
          <br />
          That's an always funny and neverending joke all devs like to sat, a
          clichè. I am 26 year old guy from the north of Italy, Como, to be more
          precise. I got a degree in computer science at the Università degli
          Studi di Milano in the early 2018. From that point on, guess what, I
          started working as developer. Actually, I've been working since before
          that day.
          <br />
          <br />
          "But, are you front-end or back-end dev?" I've got asked this question
          so many times, and the answer is always the same. I am a developer,
          and being a developer means face problem, analyze them, put a straight
          strategy to solve them, test and, if you lucky enough, solve it. Of
          course, there are so many areas as a dev, and all of them require some
          sort of mindset, but the fundamentals are those.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am mainly a backend developer, if you desperatly wanna know, a nerdy
          API designer. But I've been through a lot of front-end stuff. Also I
          had to face docker, which I think is awesome, and data manipulation.
          <br />
          <br />
          As regarding me as a person, you may have guessed I am a true fun of
          minimalism. I am a practical and organized person, always curios to
          find and try new things: discovery is growth.
          <br />
          <br />
          I a have mainly three passions: videogames, travel and reading.
