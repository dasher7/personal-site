          I am a pretty social guy, basically you can find me on most of the
          social networks.
          <br />
          <br />
          Firts of all, you should know that one of my passion is writing.
          Therefore, i created
          <a href="https://tybearder.com/" id="highlight">Tybearder</a>, a
          personal place where I can share my stories. You eventually may find
          them on Medium, as listed below, but having my little intimate space
          in this crowded world, matters to me.
          <br />
