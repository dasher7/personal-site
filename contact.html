          I am a pretty social guy, basically you can find me on most of the
          social networks available.
          <br />
          <br />
          First of all, you should know that one of my passion is writing.
          Therefore, i created
          <a href="https://tybearder.com/" id="highlight">Tybearder</a>, a
          personal place where I can share my stories. You eventually may find
          them on Medium, as listed below, but having my little intimate space
          in this crowded world, matters a lot to me.
          <br />
          <br />
          Below, a brief list:
        </p>

              Back in the days, I had a lot of fun with 3D and Blender. Some of
              my stories are based on my artworks.

              My fav social media. It's easy to use, and it's totally based on
              sharing. I love photography and here you can find find photos of
              all my travelings.
